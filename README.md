The is a sample DApp to show to to use React with Web3 and interact with a
smart contract on the blockchain.

The contract was taken and adapted from here:
[Voting.sol](https://gist.github.com/maheshmurthy/3da385a42678c3e36a8328cbe47cae5b)
I have also included it in the src folder and fixed some small compilation issues. 

The contract was deployed using Parity with the following arguments to the constructor:
['Baby Driver', 'Wonder Woman', 'A Ghost Story']

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
